# Environment Variables

Nuxt VueFire automatically picks up a few environment variables to configure Firebase from your `.env` file. These usually take precedence over other options defined in `nuxt.config.ts`. They usually try to better support the existing Firebase environment variables.

## Admin SDK

If you are doing SSR, you will need to provide the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable with the path to the service account file. This is usually a JSON file that you can download from the Firebase Console > Project Settings > Service Accounts > Generate new private key.

```
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=service-account.json
```

Make sure **to exclude both, the `.env` and `service-account.json` files from your version control system**.

::: tip
When deploying outside of Firebase, the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable has to be set manually. Instead of setting it to the path of the service account file, you can set it to the content of the file itself. Note it will have to fit in **one single line**.

## AppCheck

If you are using AppCheck, you can specify the `FIREBASE_APPCHECK_DEBUG_TOKEN` environment variable to use a debug token in development. This is useful in **protected** CI environments or if you run multiple Firebase projects on your machine and don't want to rely on the local generation of the debug token

```
FIREBASE_APPCHECK_DEBUG_TOKEN=********-****-****-****-************
```

These can be generated on the Firebase Console > AppCheck > Apps > Manage Debug Tokens.

This variable will not be used in production unless `debug: true` is passed during a build or generate command. This allows you to still test locally using a debug token without having to worry about accidentally deploying it to production.

## Debugging utilities

You can activate these while developing or building locally by setting them before running the command:

```bash
VUEFIRE_APPCHECK_DEBUG=true VUEFIRE_EMULATORS=true pnpm run build
```

- `VUEFIRE_APPCHECK_DEBUG=true` will activate the AppCheck debug even in production.
- `VUEFIRE_EMULATORS=true` will activate the Firebase Emulators even in production.
